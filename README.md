## Motivation

As Kotlin developers and users of [Kotlin Html Dsl](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/typesafe-html-dsl.html) we may want to write JavaScript code while staying in Kotlin. This tool is meant to generate JavaScript code whithin Kotlin. It's designed for scripting and providing support to JavaScript code in frontend. If your goal is to write entire projects in JavaScript using Kotlin, [WASM](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/wasm-overview.html) may be your tool. This DSL is currently under development and it's in experimental stage.
## Getting Started

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/martppa/kotlin-js-dsl/wiki). The wiki is still under development.

# Known issues

- Indentation generated by the DSL in some cases may not follow the expected spacing. It does not affect the code itself.
